In THCMPT, I effectively managed multiple responsibilities, including development, coordination with offshore teams, and addressing critical issues. Despite the challenges, I was able to simplify complex processes and create clear action plans, ensuring the timely delivery of key milestones. I focused on optimizing workflows where possible and made sure that every step was well-structured to avoid delays.

One significant challenge was the team’s capability and responsibility not meeting expectations. As a result, I took a proactive approach to delegating tasks, ensuring important decisions and tasks were clearly assigned. While delegating, I retained full ownership and accountability for the overall project outcomes. This was particularly challenging due to the skills gap within the team, but it pushed me to take on additional responsibility and provide more guidance.

Moving forward, I am committed to further refining my time management and resource allocation skills. I will continue to look for ways to optimize processes, improve team performance, and delegate more effectively to ensure better outcomes for both the team and the business.
