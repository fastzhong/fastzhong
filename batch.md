Yes, in Oracle 19 (and all Oracle versions), sequence names are case-sensitive when you enclose them in double quotes. However, if you create sequences without double quotes, Oracle will automatically convert the names to uppercase.

Spring Batch's DefaultDataFieldMaxValueIncrementerFactory (which handles sequences) has built-in logic to try different case variations when looking for sequences.
Here's how it works internally:

It first tries the sequence name exactly as constructed (lowercase)
If that fails, it tries the uppercase version
If both fail, then you get a sequence not found error

Also, verify that the user connecting to the database has proper grants:

```sql
-- Check granted privileges
SELECT * FROM user_sys_privs;
SELECT * FROM user_tab_privs;

-- Grant if needed (run as privileged user)
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON PWS_BATCH_JOB_SEQ TO your_app_user;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON PWS_BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_SEQ TO your_app_user;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON PWS_BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_SEQ TO your_app_user;
```

Check if sequences exist and are accessible:

```sql
-- Check sequences in your schema
SELECT sequence_name, sequence_owner 
FROM all_sequences 
WHERE sequence_name LIKE '%PWS_BATCH%';

-- Check public synonyms for sequences
SELECT synonym_name, table_owner, table_name 
FROM all_synonyms 
WHERE synonym_name LIKE '%PWS_BATCH%';
```


If you're using a schema other than the connecting user's default schema, you might need to specify the schema name in your configuration:

```java
factory.setTablePrefix("YOUR_SCHEMA.pws_batch_");
```

```java
@Bean
public JobRepository jobRepository(PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager,
        @Qualifier("defaultDataSource") DataSource dataSource) throws Exception {
    JobRepositoryFactoryBean factory = new JobRepositoryFactoryBean();
    factory.setTransactionManager(transactionManager);
    factory.setDataSource(dataSource);
    factory.setIsolationLevelForCreate("ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE");
    factory.setTablePrefix("pws_batch_");
    
    // Add these lines
    DefaultDataFieldMaxValueIncrementerFactory incrementerFactory = new DefaultDataFieldMaxValueIncrementerFactory(dataSource);
    incrementerFactory.setIncrementerColumnName("ID");
    factory.setIncrementerFactory(incrementerFactory);
    
    factory.afterPropertiesSet();
    return factory.getObject();
}
```
