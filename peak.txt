# Enabling Growth, Seemless Customer Experience

All strategic, regulatory & tactical projects delivered on time and within budget ( as applicable for the projects TDM/ Dev Managers are involved)
- UOBPay Infinity Single (SG, MY, HK) Tech live
- THCMPT A1.2, B.1
- CBPR+ Nov 2025 SWIFT commitments
-Supporting projects:
- SG EDP
- VASA
- OFM - EUPG
- GST Rollout (CN, HK, ID)
- GWB Online Customer Notifications

Strategic programs as per GWB and GR Transformation & Balanced Scorecard incl. Commercialization & NPS
Baseline (in EAR) and measure capability reuse for new ITC's - Target re-usability should be min 65%
Baseline and measure architecture convergence metrics (obsolescence, codebase, technical stack), target min 65% across all applications
Apply API/Microservices first approach using UFW specifications, 
Identify opportunities for Cloud and Container enablement, and platform services
Innovation, experimentation with emerging technologies, e.g., Generative AI.
At least 3-4 use cases which will help to increase efficiency, productivity and improve quality - POC should be done
Target to have at least 2 such initiatives to be embedded into project activities - Target Q3 2025

# Engineering excellence, Quality of Delivery, T2M, Cost Effectiveness

Embed Unit & exception handling testing in our build practices
For every new project, EAR has to be updated mandatory. TDM, Dev managers to track and get EAR updated
Design and pre-production gates applied incl. e2e test scope & design walkthroughs, code dependency reviews, configuration checks & impact assessments
YoY reduction in average project duration by 10% (36 days) as per ITC milestones & cycle times (Build & SIT phases) by 10% (apps onboarded to DevOps)
Harmonized release calendars & publish and communicate to stakeholders
Baseline Average Cost / Capability, plus Cost/SP (Agile) or Cost/FP (Waterfall) measured. Cost is the buid cost to be mesaured
Use GenAI for code reviews, code inspection and unit testing generation
No Sev 1 post go live of projects. Max 2 Sev - 2 for major releases and no Sev 2 for minor releases  
No more than max 5 expedited changes arising due to oversight by project team. Expedited changes done to urgently fix production issues beyond warranty is excluded. 
Min. grade A across all code quality index dimensions (Unit Test coverage, Maintainability, Security), for new and onboarded apps (legacy included)
All applications subject to minimum hard gate level 5 (incl code review, branching, unit testing)
Critical & High Defects aging: median 7 days
Reduce defect density for (SIT & UAT) to 35%, reduce UAT defect leakage to 10%, critical defect leakage to production <2%
98% availability of env for SIT and UAT for all apps. Daily monitorings should be in place and all downtimes should be planned and agreed as per the agreed downtime windows applications

# Managing Top Risks & Operational Efficiency

Zero misses on audit observations commitments
Zero regulatory breach incidents due to app changes
Zero misses on security vulnerabilities and VRAs as per SLAs
100% Process Assurance exit criteria met for Projects & QR
Tech Obs plans delivered as per commitments and milestones; no deferrals due to internal dependencies; pillar leads are TDMs for the apps
Enhanced Vendor governance incl. SLAs (onboarding lead time, 70% retention) & clearly defined escalation points
Quality gates in place (code reviews, version control, release notes)
Zero misses on Third Party Risk Assessment
 Sev1, 2 & 3 incidents: KPI's are tracked at domain level, new projects going live should not substantially create more incidents thereby breaching the KPI's. 
No missed CCM meetings
No missed PPM timesheets
No missed PPM allocation for self. Should be clocking on projects assigned. If allocation not available, should reach out to manish to get allocation
No negative feedback from key stakeholders (e.g. T&O, Business, GBT/GMET Domains, GIPS, GIS) 
No missed housekeeping, monitoring alerts, VBM extracts for apps

review 
=======
While TH CMPT is still in the development phase, I ensured that SIT had started smoothly, and I remained actively involved in monitoring potential risks, including system problems, security vulnerabilities, and UAT issues arising from other projects. I remained committed to preventing regulatory breaches related to changes in authentication matrices, data synchronization from GEB, and entitlement changes, ensuring strict adherence to compliance standards.
