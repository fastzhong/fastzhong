Identify opportunities for Cloud and Container enablement, and platform services
Innovation, experimentation with emerging technologies, e.g., Generative AI.
At least 3-4 use cases which will help to increase efficiency, productivity and improve quality - POC should be done
Target to have at least 2 such initiatives to be embedded into project activities - Target Q3 2025


# Engineering excellence, Quality of Delivery, T2M, Cost Effectiveness

Embed Unit & exception handling testing in our build practices
For every new project, EAR has to be updated mandatory. TDM, Dev managers to track and get EAR updated
Design and pre-production gates applied incl. e2e test scope & design walkthroughs, code dependency reviews, configuration checks & impact assessments
YoY reduction in average project duration by 10% (36 days) as per ITC milestones & cycle times (Build & SIT phases) by 10% (apps onboarded to DevOps)
Harmonized release calendars & publish and communicate to stakeholders
Baseline Average Cost / Capability, plus Cost/SP (Agile) or Cost/FP (Waterfall) measured. Cost is the buid cost to be mesaured
Use GenAI for code reviews, code inspection and unit testing generation
No Sev 1 post go live of projects. Max 2 Sev - 2 for major releases and no Sev 2 for minor releases  
No more than max 5 expedited changes arising due to oversight by project team. Expedited changes done to urgently fix production issues beyond warranty is excluded. 
Min. grade A across all code quality index dimensions (Unit Test coverage, Maintainability, Security), for new and onboarded apps (legacy included)
All applications subject to minimum hard gate level 5 (incl code review, branching, unit testing)
Critical & High Defects aging: median 7 days
Reduce defect density for (SIT & UAT) to 35%, reduce UAT defect leakage to 10%, critical defect leakage to production <2%
98% availability of env for SIT and UAT for all apps. Daily monitorings should be in place and all downtimes should be planned and agreed as per the agreed downtime windows applications

# Managing Top Risks & Operational Efficiency

Zero misses on audit observations commitments
Zero regulatory breach incidents due to app changes
Zero misses on security vulnerabilities and VRAs as per SLAs
100% Process Assurance exit criteria met for Projects & QR
Tech Obs plans delivered as per commitments and milestones; no deferrals due to internal dependencies; pillar leads are TDMs for the apps
Enhanced Vendor governance incl. SLAs (onboarding lead time, 70% retention) & clearly defined escalation points
Quality gates in place (code reviews, version control, release notes)
Zero misses on Third Party Risk Assessment
 Sev1, 2 & 3 incidents: KPI's are tracked at domain level, new projects going live should not substantially create more incidents thereby breaching the KPI's. 
No missed CCM meetings
No missed PPM timesheets
No missed PPM allocation for self. Should be clocking on projects assigned. If allocation not available, should reach out to manish to get allocation
No negative feedback from key stakeholders (e.g. T&O, Business, GBT/GMET Domains, GIPS, GIS) 
No missed housekeeping, monitoring alerts, VBM extracts for apps

review 
=======
Successfully implemented an API/Microservices-first approach using UFW specifications for TH CMPT A1.2 development, enabling the delivery of new products and features, including bulk file upload, manage batch, customer report, and audit functionalities. Several features were built from scratch, aligning with strategic program goals for commercialization and NPS baseline as per GWB and GR Transformation & Balanced Scorecard.

Leveraged Generative AI tools to enhance developer productivity, resolving technical issues (e.g., Java exceptions, SQL query optimization), analyzing existing code behavior, and auto-generating unit tests. Completed three proof-of-concept (POC) use cases, meeting the target of 3-4 use cases, contributing to increased efficiency, productivity, and quality.

Enhanced Liquibase workflows to support the complex TH environment (e.g., coexistence of A1.1, A1.2, and B1.1 in a single environment), improving deployment reliability and configuration management.

Struggled with aging critical and high defects (median 10 days vs. target 7 days) during UAT sign-off due to high defect volumes. Skill on effective resource allocation plan and defect prioritization framework is required to meet the 7-day median target in future. 

For the first A1.2 PI release, post-go-live issues (e.g., missing Liquibase files, batch JAR, configuration errors, and filewatcher scripts) were promptly rectified with no PVT impact. The first A1.2 PI release encountered issues (e.g., missing files, configuration errors), highlighting the need for stricter pre-production gate checks. Enhanced configuration management and validation processes to be learned and improved to prevent recurrence.

=======

Effectively translated high-level requirements for TH CMPT A1.2 into actionable plans, defining clear milestones for features and following the SDM. Team execution speed was not always satisfactory and vendor management skills need improved to address team member responsibility and time management issues. 

Fostered an inclusive environment by encouraging participation from diverse team members, including SAs, experienced developers, and new developers, ensuring varied perspectives enriched the A1.2 project development. 

Skills in handling issues with stakeholders, require improvement, alongside formalizing team development plans, to be enhanced, particularly in managing difficult conversations to ensure accountability without straining relationships.
